# Game-Development
Welcome the player to the game.
Display basic instructions for the player to input their choice: Stone, Paper, or Scissors, or to exit the game.
If the player chooses to exit, display a farewell message and end the game.
If the player's input is not one of the valid options, show an error message and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Convert the player's choice to an integer index (0 for Stone, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors) by indexing and storing the options in an array.
Generate a random choice for the computer (0 for Stone, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors) using the "random" module.
Display the choices made by both the player and the computer.
Compare the choices to determine the winner:
    Use conditional statements (if, elif, else) to handle all possible outcomes.
    If the choices are the same, declare it a tie.
    If the player wins according to the game's rules (Stone crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, Paper covers Stone), display a victory message.
    Otherwise, declare the computer as the winner and display a corresponding message.
Repeat the game loop until the player chooses to exit.
